!!! Warning !!! 

!!! Proceed with Caution !!!

By installing Nocturne, you're about to embark on a thrilling adventure 
where your system will undergo some serious changes. Here's what you’re 
signing up for:

New Software: You’ll be welcoming a whole new set of applications to your 
system. Think of it as a software party where everyone’s invited. Don’t worry, 
we’ve vetted the guests... mostly.

Defaults Changes: Your default settings are getting a makeover. Think of it 
as a personal stylist giving your desktop a fresh new look and feel. We promise 
it’s not a mullet.

Possible Side Effects: In rare and dramatic cases, this installation may break 
your system. It’s like a box of chocolates—you never really know what you're 
gonna get. But hey, if things go sideways, we recommend a solid backup and a 
sense of humor. It’s only a system, not a life.

Best Experience: For optimal results, make sure you're logged into a GNOME 
session before starting the installation. Trust us, it’ll make everything 
smoother and less like trying to assemble IKEA furniture in the dark.

!!! Disclaimer !!!

By proceeding with this installation, you accept full responsibility for 
any possible damage, system instability, or chaos caused to your machine. 
The creator of Nocturne takes absolutely no responsibility for any unforeseen 
consequences. If your system ends up in a digital dumpster fire, 
remember: we warned you.

If you're ready for the challenge, select 1 like a true tech adventurer. 
Otherwise, feel free to select 2 and keep living life in the comfort zone. 

The choice is yours!

This is your last chance to stop the installation and backup your system. 
You have been warned!

This istaller will ask you multiple times to provide your password. This is 
expected behavior since we can't really install software without your password.
There will also be GNOME popups asking you to enable features. I highly recommend
enabling them (this is something we can't really automate so...)

If you are an Arch user and you don't trust AUR for software, or don't like 
using yay as your AUR helper, this is the correct time to bail outi. 
Nocturne uses AUR and we (major royal we here) the development team like 
to use yay as our AUR helper so tough luck.

If for any reason you don't want to use GNOME, and want to have Nocturne 
installed for other desktop environments, please wait for the next release.
Support for shell only installation, and other desktop environments (KDE, Cosmic,
<your favorite linux desktop environment>) is on our roadmap. We are working hard
to have it available soon(tm). In the meanwhile this means that you should exit 
now (seriously) since only GNOME is supported for now.

Your shell will be replaced by zsh, oh-my-zsh will be installed and configured
for your account. If you don't like zsh for any reason, exit now.
